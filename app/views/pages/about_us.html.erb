<h1>About us</h1>

<p>We are an international skilled team of four, mixed up randomly out of attendees of a popular coding bootcamp: Le Wagon. We invented the AllShare! project to contribute our part for making the world a better place, to build up communities and to reduce individual carbon footprints. We are bringing people and their needs together.</p>
<p>If you want to join us, donâ€™t hesitate and <a href="mailto:team@allshare.online">mail</a> us to team@allshare.online.</p>
